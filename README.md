Here is my presentation to you guys 🤎✨

So you wanna know a little more about me?

I am a 25-year-old French female biology 🔬🧬 student driven by curiosity and a passion for learning and handcrafting. While my formal studies focus on biology, I am excited to transition into bioinformatics for my master’s degree. Though my current academic path doesn’t include computer science, I am a dedicated self-learner, eagerly exploring informatics on my own. I discovered it during my past post-BAC vet studies and absolutely fell in love with this discipline because it literally consists of expressing our creativity by solving logic and math problems, which is all I love.
My natural curiosity and motivation, complemented by my discipline, overflowing energy, and joyful but really rational and scientific approach to life, keep me constantly engaged—whether in all my numerous projects. Indeed, next to my studies, I am a candidate to become a volunteer firefighter and a French army reservist. I love growing by always pushing my limits further, and I’m motivated by the dream of finding a meaningful job where I can contribute and feel useful for our society. Thus, I am a gym-addict, training at least 2 hours per day. My sports of predilection are weightlifting 🏋️, calisthenics 🤸🏼‍♀️, and running 🏃🏼‍♀️. I did my first half-marathon on June 1st, 2025, and it was a very enriching experience.
As you can see, I work hard for my ambitious projects and really love to live a fulfilled life 🤎.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about quantum mechanics—actually mathematics in general—and philosophy (I’m in love with Nietzsche), playing guitar, and taking care of what is the most precious in my world: my little baby dog 🐶🤎. We both are little creatures, but don’t underestimate us: together we could run all over the world 💪🏼✨.

But why am I working so hard? Well, I have a very specific long-term personal project that guides my way. Indeed, I wish to one day live on a field of at least 10ha, as autonomous as possible, with my little family, surrounded by nature. I think that we are completely disconnected from reality today and from what the real consequences of our actions on our environment are. I wish for a fair and meaningful life. Furthermore, as a haunted child, I wish to spread the power and resilience I have built by guiding other children in difficulty. Because you don’t need to face the tragedies that crossed my way to become a beautiful and powerful person, full of true mental peace and happiness. And I think that taking care of them in this specific environment would be turning the tables on life. Thus, I’m naturally passionate about permaculture, gardening, farm work, education, and all handcrafting which stems from this project, such as wool and woodworking, for example.

Well, I think you now have a great idea of who I am. Any questions? Or do you wish to work with my very atypical personality and approach to life and problems? Don’t hesitate to contact me—I am easy to approach and discuss with, no worries 😉.
Take care of yourself—you only have one life 🤎✨
