# Hello-world
Here is my presentation to you guys 🤎✨

So you wanna know a little more about me ?

  I am a biology 🔬🧬 25 female french student driven by curiosity and a passion for learning and hand crafting. While my formal studies focus on biology, I am excited to transition into bioinformatics for my master’s degree. Though my current academic path doesn’t include computer science, I am a dedicated self-learner, eagerly exploring informatics on my own. I discoverded it during my past post-BAC vet studies and absolutely fall in love for this discipline cause it litterally consists expressing our creativity by solving logic and mathematic problems which is all I love. 
  My natural curiosity and motivation completing by my discipline, overflowing energy, and joyful but really rational and scientific approach to life keep me constantly engaged—whether in all my numerous projects. Inded next to my studies I candidate to become a volunteer firefighter and a french army reservist. I love growing by allways pushing my limits further and I'm motivated by the dream of finding a meaningful job where I can contribute and feel useful for our society. Thus I am a gymgirl addict training at least 2 hours per day. My sports of predilection are musculation 🏋️, callsthenic 🤸🏼‍♀️ and running 🏃🏼‍♀️. I did my first half-marathon in June the 1st of 2025 and that was a very enriching experience. 
  As you can see, I work hard for my ambitious projects and really love to live a fullfiled life 🤎. 

  Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about quantum mechanics - but mathematics in general - and philosophy - I'm in love with Nietszche -, playing guitar, and taking care of what is the most precious in my world : my little baby dog 🐶🤎. We both are little creatures but don't underestimate us : togather we could run everywhere 💪🏼✨.
